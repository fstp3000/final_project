### Abstract
The current inspection process for organic verification is opaque and cumbersome, and is based on inconsistent standards from random samples; to simplify this process, we propose a new course of action using blockchain.

### Blockchain Application
Insect populations, of which are essential to maintaining ecosystem balance, are being decimated by pesticides all throughout the world. The first think that might come to your mind is: What role might blockchain play in combating this phenomenon? Good question!<br>
Proving the organic status of agri-cultural products has been and re-mains one of the most difficult pro-cesses in the agricultural industry.<br>
First of all, what is organic defined as? According to the Taiwan government:<br>
Existing methods require verification by numerous agencies.<br>
On January 29, 2007, the Agricultural Product Production and Verification Management Law was passed, and the definition of organic agricultural products in the domestic production, processing and packaging process should be consistent with the “organic norms” set by the relevant authority and verified by law, or import agricultural products that have passed the examination.<br>
什麼叫”有機“呢? [1] 根據農委會的定義：「有機農業是遵守自然資源循環永續利用原則，不允許使用合成化學物質，強調水土資源保育與生態平衡之管理系統，並達到生產自然安全農產品目標之農業。」2 007年1月，農委會開始實施「農產品生產及驗證管理法」，「有機農業」及其產品即納入政府的法律規範。相關規範請參考本網站「驗證與機構」中的「有機農業驗證規範及法規」。<br>
